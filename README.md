# Data Communications Group Project
This is a group project worked on by Holly Puckett, Evan Rowe, and Seth Gardner. This program was written for our Data Communications and Networking class. 

The purpose of this program is to make both a client and server-side program using sockets, so that the multi-chat application is able to communicate over the network. This program was written in Java and uses a GUI to showcase the application.
